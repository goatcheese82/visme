This article by Tristan Scott in Flathead Living for Fall 2017 is a great example of how a good design can bring attention to an article. The variety and contrast used for the typefaces, coupled with the raw and in your face image give it a real feeling of what it's about.

<h2>Typeface Categorization</h2>

![Typefaces](/visme/images/magazine-typefaces.svg)

In the above image we see that 3 typefaces are used. For the title we get a casual Script typeface, for the subtitle a more impersonal Sans Serif, and finally for the text we get a trusty Oldstyle.

<h2>Typeface Explanation</h2>

It's hard to mistake the swooping strokes of the script, with the walls of the font fading into the paper as if written with a sharpie. We see loose strokes often indicative of handwriting.
The Sans Serif used is a bit harder to place as the designer opted for all capitols, but light font weight gives it a modern look.
The text itself adopts the transitional serifs of an oldstyle typeface, with thick/thin transitions in the curves.

<h2>Image Analyzation</h2>

The image is a great display of the use of thirds, as well as depth of field. the focal points of the man's hands and face lie almost directly on the upper right third and the lower right third. Focus is placed on what is happening in front of us, and softened for the background, giving us a sense of the distance and open space we are dealing with.
